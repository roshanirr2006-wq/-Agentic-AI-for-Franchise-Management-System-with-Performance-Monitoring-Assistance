# Overall Project Explanation

## Problem Statement

Managing a franchise network with multiple outlets requires continuous monitoring of workforce performance, outlet revenue, inventory, marketing campaigns, customer feedback and compliance.

Traditional dashboards mainly display historical information but do not always help managers understand **why a problem is occurring, which area requires attention, or what action could be considered next**.

**FranchiseOps AI** addresses this problem by combining operational data, machine-learning model comparisons, interactive analytics, an AI Copilot, multilingual SOP translation, document analysis and administrative monitoring in a single Streamlit-based application.

## Solution Summary

FranchiseOps AI provides a central decision-support platform for franchise owners, managers, staff and administrators. The application reads operational information from a SQLite database and routes business questions to the appropriate intelligence module. Specialised agents provide analytics and predictions for workforce, outlets, inventory, marketing, customer sentiment and compliance. An AI Copilot can generate responses using retrieved application data and contextual information rather than relying only on free-form generation.

The application also includes authentication, role-based access, OTP-based password recovery, an Admin Dashboard, multilingual translation, PDF/SOP analysis, operational alerts and reporting utilities.

# Key Differentiators

### Grounded AI Assistance

The AI Copilot receives operational context from the application's database and business modules before generating responses.

### Transparent ML Comparison

Several agents display comparative model-performance tables so that users can see how different models perform instead of receiving an unexplained prediction.

### Role Awareness

The application supports different user roles and provides different levels of access.

### Fail-Soft AI Design

The application can continue displaying operational analytics while the LLM service is loading or unavailable.

### Multilingual Support

Agent 8 provides multilingual SOP and text translation using the NLLB-200 model.

### Document Intelligence

Agent 9 allows users to upload PDF, TXT and Markdown documents and search their extracted content.

---

# Hardware Requirements

The application contains machine-learning and LLM components.

### Recommended

* Python 3.10+
* 8 GB RAM minimum
* 16 GB RAM recommended
* NVIDIA CUDA-capable GPU recommended for faster LLM/translation inference
* Several GB of disk space for model weights and caches

### CPU Mode

The application can run without a CUDA GPU, but LLM and translation operations may be significantly slower.

### Model Runtime

The current final notebook uses:

```text
Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct
```

and:

```text
facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M
```

The project also contains a FastAPI model service for local generation and translation.

---

# Expected Installation Time & Disk Usage

Installation time depends on internet speed, CPU/GPU and whether model weights are already cached.

The LLM and translation models can require **several GB of storage**, especially after downloading model weights and dependencies.

The first model load may take several minutes. Subsequent runs can be faster when cached.

requirements.txt
```

The current notebook includes dependencies for:

* Streamlit
* Streamlit Option Menu
* Streamlit-Folium
* Deep Translator
* Transformers
* PyTorch
* SentencePiece
* Accelerate
* pdfplumber
* ReportLab
* bcrypt
* Flask
* Plotly

### Important final-submission requirement

Before final submission, regenerate `requirements.txt` from a clean virtual environment:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Then remove packages that are not actually required by the final application and verify the result in a brand-new environment.

All final package versions should be **pinned using `==`**.

Example:

```text
streamlit==<tested-version>
pandas==<tested-version>
numpy==<tested-version>
plotly==<tested-version>
scikit-learn==<tested-version>
torch==<tested-version>
transformers==<tested-version>
```

Do not claim that `requirements.txt` has been clean-venv tested until this has actually been completed.

# Operating-System Dependencies

Some environments may require additional system packages.

For video compression:

```text
HandBrake or FFmpeg
```

For PDF processing, the Python application primarily uses `pdfplumber`, but system-level PDF tooling may be required if additional PDF workflows are introduced.

For GPU execution:

```text
NVIDIA driver
CUDA-compatible PyTorch installation
```

must be compatible with the target environment.

### Suggested demo sequence

```text
1. Login
2. Dashboard
3. Forgot Password / OTP flow
4. Workforce or Outlet Agent
5. Inventory/Marketing/Customer Agent
6. AI Copilot grounded question
7. Multilingual translation
8. PDF/document analysis
9. Admin Dashboard
```

### Demo Security

Use a **fresh dummy account**.

Never display:

* Personal Gmail credentials
* Real Gmail inbox
* Real OTP messages
* API tokens
* Hugging Face tokens
* Personal customer information
* Private database information

If the MP4 is larger than GitHub's file limit, host it externally and place the link in this section.

Example:

```markdown

# `.gitignore`

The repository should contain a `.gitignore` similar to:

```gitignore
# Environment
.env
.env.*
!.env.example

# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*.pyo
*.pyd

# Jupyter
.ipynb_checkpoints/
*.ipynb_checkpoints

# Virtual environments
venv/
.venv/

# Databases
*.db
*.sqlite
*.sqlite3

# Runtime data

# Secrets
secrets.toml
.streamlit/secrets.toml

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
```

---

# `.env.example`

Commit only variable names/placeholders.

Example:

```env
HF_TOKEN=
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=

EMAIL_ID=
EMAIL_PASSWORD=

JWT_SECRET_KEY=

FRANCHISEOPS_DATA_DIR=
```

Never commit the real `.env`.

Verify that Git ignores it:

```bash
git check-ignore -v .env
```

---

# Security Warning Before Git Push

The final repository must be searched for:

```text
password
token
secret
api_key
key
EMAIL_ID
EMAIL_PASSWORD
HF_TOKEN
```

Use:

```bash
git grep -n -i "password"
git grep -n -i "token"
git grep -n -i "secret"
```

and inspect notebooks as well as Python source files.

### Critical

The current development notebook contains demo authentication credentials in its sample-data seeding logic.

**Those credentials must be removed or replaced with a secure environment/secret-based mechanism before the notebook or generated source files are pushed to the public repository.**

Do not rely on deleting the visible line after committing it. If credentials were previously committed, rotate/revoke them and clean the Git history where appropriate.

# Known Limitations & Future Scope

## Current Limitations

1. **Synthetic/demo data**
   The project uses generated/sample franchise datasets for demonstration and development.

2. **SQLite database**
   SQLite is suitable for a demonstration or small deployment but is not the ideal production database for a large multi-user franchise network.

3. **Local model execution**
   LLM and translation performance depends heavily on available CPU/GPU hardware.

4. **Document retrieval implementation**
   The current notebook provides a lightweight document retrieval implementation. A production deployment can replace it with a fully persistent vector database and embedding-based retrieval pipeline.

5. **Single application deployment**
   The current architecture is primarily designed around a Streamlit application and local/Colab execution.

## Future Improvements

1. Migrate SQLite to PostgreSQL or another production-grade database.

2. Add a production vector database and embedding-based RAG pipeline.

3. Introduce automated model training pipelines with real historical franchise data.

4. Deploy the LLM and AI services using scalable cloud infrastructure.

5. Add advanced monitoring, observability and automated model-performance tracking.

6. Integrate real-time enterprise data sources such as POS, ERP, inventory and CRM systems.

7. Strengthen production authentication with enterprise SSO/OAuth and more comprehensive RBAC policies.
